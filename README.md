* oneAPI is an open, cross-architecture programming model that frees developers to use a single code base across multiple architectures. The result is accelerated compute without vendor lock-in.
* The objective of this hackathon is to build solutions with oneAPI for compelling problems identified. Developers can choose to work in the themes of the ML, Computer Vision, and Open Innovation theme. The developers are expected to build the solutions using the IntelÂ® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkits.
* The project submission has to be Open-source in nature, it has to use open-source technologies(Scikit, Intel oneAPI) otherwise it won't be accepted in the project(As it needs to tested and evaluated during judging).
* *Shashwat's Query*: Regarding projects in the medical image processing field with significant problem statements, is it necessary to develop specific models for particular diseases, or is it possible to create multiple models for multiple diseases or a single disease? I would appreciate it if you could provide guidance on what approach to take.
*Answer by Mentor(Kazi Sir)*: There are no restrictions on the types of diseases that can be targeted in the development of medical image processing projects. Therefore, the choice to focus on a specific disease or a category of diseases is entirely up to the you guys. So, single or multiple diseases can also be addressed. I hope this answer satisfies your query.
## Problem Statements
**Medical Image Analysis:** Develop computer vision projects using Scikit-Learn's image processing capabilities to analyze medical images, such as X-rays or MRI scans. This could include building models to identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate the presence of a disease or condition.

## Intel DevCloud for oneAPI
Intel provides with Cloud Services with [DevCloud](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/) to learn about oneAPI.
It provides complete code samples and training modules you can access for free for 3 months. 
## Intel oneAPI Toolkits
Intel [oneAPI Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html).
The main criteria of this hackathon is that we would **have** to use atleast one toolkit or atleast a part of it. For example one can use, Intel-optimized python, Intel-optimized Scikit-Lab.
**Intel AI Analytics Toolkit**
- Intel Optimization for TensorFlow
- Develop in Cloud
